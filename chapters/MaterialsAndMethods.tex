As anticipated in Section \ref{sec:roleofpediatrician} at page \pageref{sec:roleofpediatrician},  internationally adopted children in Italy get tested in one of 20 centers, one per region. In Friuli-Venezia Giulia, this center is placed in \textit{San Vito al Tagliamento}, where the data for this paper was collected. International adoptees are brought to this hospital by the adoptive parents as an autonomous decision or because they have been previously advised by adoption organizations or their trusted pediatrician. The child is hospitalized for just one day. This is minimum time required in order to obtain all the necessary samples for laboratory examination (blood, stool, \textit{etc}\dots) and to complete all clinical evaluations, while minimizing the stress the child must bear.

All 20 Italian adoption-focused centers follow the \textit{ad hoc} GLNBI diagnostic - aiding protocol,  in order to identify infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, immunization status, intestinal parasitosis, or other pathologies. These can be found in \cite{GNLBI1}, \cite{GNLBI2}, and \cite{GNLBI3}.

From \nth{1} January 2002 to \nth{31} December 2017 data was collected of all children evaluated by the \textit{San Vito al Tagliamento} GLNBI Center. Data regarding date of birth, sex, birthplace, arrival date in Italy, date of the first visit at our clinic and any possible health certificate they might have carried along were recorded for each child (family history, past and recent medical history, any previously performed laboratory test, vaccine certifications, \textit{etc}\dots) (see \cite{redbook}).\\
Laboratory blood tests included serological research of vaccine immunization (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Poliomyelitis, Rubella, Mumps and Measles), serological tests for ongoing or previous infections with HIV, Syphilis, HBV, HCV, blood count, and dosing of ferritin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D and parathormone. Moreover, Mantoux test, aiming to evaluate any ongoing or previous tubercular infection, microbiological test of fecal samples for parasitological investigation and thyroid hormones levels were performed.
Along with these laboratory tests, a complete physical examination for assessing the overall child health status was performed and, when facing potential specific pathology, a specialist’s visit (paediatric orthopaedist, dermatologist, otorhinolaryngologist, endocrinologist, surgeon, ECG or echocardiogram) were prescribed.

A statistical evaluation on the collected data was conducted; $p value < 0.05$ was considered statistically significant. For more information on the statistical tests we employed, please see Section \ref{sec:statisticalanalyses}.

\paragraph*{Ethics committee approval} This study was approved by the ethics committee of the \textit{Burlo Garofolo Children's Hospital}, before beginning, and was conducted always bearing in mind the children's best interest.

\section{The population in exam}\label{sec:thepopulationinexam}
285 internationally adopted children were evaluated from January \nth{1} 2002 to December \nth{31} 2017; 102 were female (36.17\%) and 180 male (63.83\%). The 3 missing children are due to this parameter never being registered in the dataset. The mean ($m$) age at time of evaluation was 5.2 years (67.8 months), with a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of 2.98 years. The age range spanned from 6 to 156 months. Age overlapped in females and males: for the first group, $m$ was 5.53 and $\sigma$ 3.01; in the latter, $m$ was 5.06 and $\sigma$ 2.97.\\
Moreover, children were evaluated approximately 2 months after their arrival in Italy ($m$ 2.23 months, $\sigma$ 2.07).

The study sample was highly representative of the original population, since 99.65\% ($284/285$) of the internationally adopted children in Friuli-Venezia Giulia during the this period were included. See Section \ref{sub:inclusionandexclusionciteria} for more information on the inclusion and exclusion criteria used.

The entire population was divided into 4 groups, in order to better establish whether geographical origin was a relevant factor in many of the later examined pathologies. Next to every zone, the color used in Figure \ref{fig:populationperyear} to represent it is included. The four areas were:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Africa} \ref{figdata:africa}, including:
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Benin
    			\item Burkina Faso
    			\item Congo
    			\item Ethiopia
    			\item Ghana
    			\item Guinea Bissau
    			\item Ivory Coast
    		\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Asia} \ref{figdata:asia}, including:
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Armenia
    			\item China
    			\item India
    			\item Nepal
    			\item Philippines
    			\item Siberia
    			\item Sri Lanka
    			\item Vietnam
    		\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Eastern Europe} \ref{figdata:easterneurope}, including:
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Albania
    			\item Bulgaria
    			\item Hungary
    			\item Moldavia
    			\item Romania
    			\item Russian Federation
    			\item Ukraine
    		\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Latin America} \ref{figdata:latinamerica}, including:
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Brazil
    			\item Colombia
    			\item Costa Rica
    			\item Guatemala
    			\item Peru
    		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The study sample grew year after year, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:populationperyear}. In particular, it increased rapidly between 2002 and 2010; after that, the total number of children brought to our attention stabilized (more or less) for the rest of the study, until its end in 2017.

\subsection{Cut-off values}\label{sub:cutoffvalues}
Cut-off values for these results were established via the most recent literature review.

%INSERT WHERE THEY COME FROM

\subsubsection{Haemoglobin}\label{sub:haemoglobin}
This was a little prick, but we managed with \cite{Hbcutoff} (from WHO).
It depends on:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sex
	\item Age
	\item Altitude (looking only at sea level)
\end{enumerate}
Based on Haemoglobin levels, we stratified anemias in:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Non-Anemia
	\item Mild
	\item Moderate
	\item Severe
\end{enumerate}
This is summarized in Table that follows.

\subsubsection{Vitamin D}\label{sub:vitaminD}
Vitamin D is healthy. We dosed $25\-OH$ or \textit{colecalciferol} (1,25(OH)2D: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25(OH)D: 25-hydroxyvitamin D)...\\
Recent literature has openly discussed about how vitamin D deficiency should be defined, especially in pediatric age. \cite{vitDcutoff1} is a really strong and recent (2018) Italian review on vitamin D deficiency. Another review is in \cite{vitDcutoff2}. From BMJ is \cite{vitDcutoff3}. And maybe strongest of all the letter addressed to BMJ from the British Society of Pediatric Radiology and child protection and nutrition committees of the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health in \cite{vitDcutoff_letter}.\\
General international consensus is on defining cut-off values based on alkaline phosfatase and calcium levels so to enhance ONLY bone health, ignoring the now well-known vitamin D extra-skeletal effects.

As explained in \ref{sec:roleofpediatrician}, internationally adopted children often suffer from vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, because of the profound change in latitude they experience during the adoption phase, or because of malnutrition combined with lack of solar exposure during pre-adoptive care, usually in orphanages.

\subsection{Parasites grouping}\label{sub:parasites}
These are the considered pathogens.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Group 1
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Entamoeba
			\item Ancylostoma
			\item Trichuris
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Group 2
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Giardia
			\item Strongyloides
			\item Hymenolepis
			\item Blastocystis
			\item Endolimax
		\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

We conceived them like this:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Group 1: Parasites responsible for gastrointestinal bleeding and, therefore, iron-deficient mycroctic anemia .
	\item Group 2: Parasites responsible for gastrointestinal malabsorbtion.
\end{itemize}

\section{Statistical Analyses}\label{sec:statisticalanalyses}
The population-describing analyses were conducted using relative frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and means and standard deviations or medians and inter-quartile intervals for continuous ones. We preferred to use the latter because the scarcity of data prevented us from checking for normal distribution.\\
Nonparametric tests, such as \textit{Mann-Whitney} or \textit{Kruskal-Wallis} tests, were employed to evaluate the difference between continuous variables in different groups. One test or the other was performed based on the number of groups, case by case: if two, the \textit{Mann-Whitney} test was used, if more than two, \textit{Krusal-Wallis}. To study the relation between two dichotomous variables, or one dichotomous and one categorical, we used the \textit{two-tailed Fisher's exact test}. To study whether a dichotomous event was associated with one or more independent variables, we used logistic regression.\\
In order to study the correlation between continuous variables, we preferred using \textit{Spearman's rank correlation}.

All statistical analyses were conducted using the Stata/IC software, version 14.2 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, USA).
