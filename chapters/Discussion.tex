\chap{Discussion}\label{chap:discussion}
In the following and last chapter of this thesis, the results presented in Chapter \ref{chap:results} will be discussed. We'll focus on describing the most common diseases among internationally adopted children (in Section \ref{sec:healthstatusofIAC}), analyzing which tests are in our opinion worthwhile amongst the ones listed in the GNLBI protocol (in Section \ref{sec:worthwhile?}), and lastly present our conclusions on the most relevant statistical correlations we found (in Section \ref{sec:seekingforsupport}). 

\section{Health status of internationally adopted children}\label{sec:healthstatusofIAC}
We found that statural and ponderal delayed growth are fairly common among international adoptees. These alterations are probably complex and multifactorial. We did not find statistical evidence for any possible cause, but we believe that FASD (that wasn't considered in this study), malnutrition, anemia, tuberculosis and gastrointestinal parasitic infections are the most probable major factors in determining this growth delay. Literature shows that these children are \textit{late bloomers} and they will grow up to their range height and weight during adolescence.

Then, anemia was found to be another frequent condition. It resulted linked to iron-deficiency for the most part, enforcing the need for iron supplements. The other leading cause is $\beta$-thalassemia minor, which strongly requires serum protein electrophoresis, alongside a complete blood count. On the other hand, our study evidenced that gastrointestinal parasitic infections, despite being very common, are not a common cause on anemia in internationally adopted children, as instead modern literature and common knowledge would suggest.

As for the immunization status, this often offers an incomplete protection from vaccine-preventable diseases (65\% of all children) and, therefore, it should be strongly advised to screen all internationally adopted children for their immunization status at their arrival in each country of destination,. We concur with international guidelines that pre-adoptive immunization records may not be assumed as truthful or correct.

Moreover, vitamin D serum levels are commonly deficient or insufficient in international adoptees (40\%). This consideration strongly reinforces the need for vitamin D prophylaxis  in this special population, perhaps even without testing for vitamin D status, if the clinical evaluation that suggest rickets.

Lastly, infectious diseases are common among international adoptees, but these are rarely severe: HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis are almost never present: 1, 4, 0 and 1 cases respectively in our 17-year-spanning study. On the other hand latent tuberculosis (16.84\%) and gastrointestinal parasitic infection (41.22\%) are fairly common.

In the following section \ref{sec:worthwhile?}, we'll present our recommendations in light of these new findings.

\section{Is everything we do worthwhile?}\label{sec:worthwhile?}
The \textit{GLNBI diagnostic-aiding protocol} (found in \cite{GNLBI2}) is a milestone for adoption-specialized pediatricians. Although it's thorough and complete, it may be too extensive for a universally applied screening protocol, and not all of the recommended tests and examinations are useful in a cost-benefit perspective. In particular, some sections do not directly influence the operative clinical path the child must follow and are therefore suppressible. Others, on the other hand, have a very strong impact on the child's health and strongly influence the further development of child's clinical plan.

In the following Sections \ref{sub:worthwhile} and \ref{sub:notworthwhile}, our considerations about the different segments of the protocol will be presented.

\section{Seeking for support: building correlations}\label{sec:seekingforsupport}
As explained in Section \ref{sec:statisticalinference} on page \pageref{sec:statisticalinference}, we strongly believed in the need for strong results from statistical inference, and, therefore, this was one of the main focus points of this study. As explained in \ref{sec:aim}, the research for correlations amongst the considered variables could have meant spare some hospitalization time and some invasive tests from the children brought to our attention, achieving benefits on an economical, health and comfort level.

Most of our findings in revolved around anemia.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Anemia and MCV}. This correlation enforces the knowledge of the high prevalence of iron-deficient anemia. The leading causes are: malnutrition and insufficient iron daily intake, and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. The last option that must be considered in internationally adopted children is $\beta$-thalassemia minor.
	\item \textbf{Low-MCV anemia and ferritin}. This correlation strengthens even more the need for acknowledgment of the high prevalence of iron-deficient anemia. Moreover, it boldly calls for iron supplement-based therapy or prophylaxis in the internationally adopted child.
	\item \textbf{Low-MCV anemia and country of origin}. Regarding iron-deficient anemia, special attention should be payed to children coming from the Russian Federation and Bulgaria, in Eastern Europe, and India, in Asia.
	\item \textbf{Ferritin and group 1 gastrointestinal parasitic infection}. The finding justifies the need for parasite grouping and the little for need for them to be considered \textit{genus} by \textit{genus}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objectives achieved}\label{secd:objectivesachieved}
In Section \ref{sec:aim} on page \pageref{sec:aim}, the aim of the study was presented. These were achieved in period of seven months. We evaluated the most common diseases among internationally adopted children, we found which tests could be overabundant and found useful correlations that stress the strongest urges of internationally adopted children.

\section{Future work}\label{sec:futurework}
Despite us believing that many goals set for this study have been achieved, we also think that future work can be done in order to accomplish a better understanding of this particular pediatric population. Other studies with a larger population in exam could highlight correlations we weren't able to find. In particular, low height-for-age, \textit{genera}-specific parasitic infections, and tuberculosis seem have space for improvements in their diagnostic and therapeutic processes.

Moreover, the establishment of a national database could be the next step taken to allow all 20 Italian GLNBI Centers to contribute to further study which pathologies affect these children. National and international policies constantly alter infectious diseases' epidemiology, thus a dedicated and steady surveillance is mandatory, in order to allow at least some degree of plasticity in operative practices.
