\chap{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
Children's health has historically always been a sensitive and concerning matter for human kind. We can find reason for this in our universal instinctive draw towards the protection and care for our offspring, and in how children can be struck by some of the most devastating and life-wrecking diseases. Sometimes, these are the phenotypical expression of genetical marks, scarred onto and into these kids. Despite the origin, the color of the skin or the culture the child bears in his lineage, human beings feel the need to raise and safeguard them from all harms, on a physical, emotional and spiritual level. This is one of the strongest biological calls to action.

Thus, pediatrics must care and remember that children's health and well-being must be guarded across political borders, across poverty, across starvation. This thesis, and the paper it's so deeply bound to, set themselves to renew this vow.

\section{Intercountry and international adoptees}\label{sec:internationaladoptees}
International adoptees are children with special needs: a vulnerable pediatric population with a chronic condition that requires access to a wide variety of healthcare services (as defined by \cite{notonlyinfectious} and \cite{nonsoloinfezioni}); they are recognized as a group of children requiring medical attention (see \cite{caringfor}). Compared to 19\% of the general population, approximately 39\% of adopted children require special healthcare attention (as extensively explained in \cite{nelson}). They are of school age, part of a sibling group, members of historically oppressed racial or ethnic groups, or they have considerable physical, emotional, or developmental need: all potential elements of vulnerability endangering the child's healthy upbringing. This is not a limited problem: annually more than 30.000 kids are adopted across countries, and, in the United States, of all 136.000 national adoptees in 2008, almost 25\% come from foreign countries; U.S. families adopted 22.884 children in 2004, mostly from China (which accounts for 33\% alone), Ehtiopia, Russia and South Korea (see \cite{nelson}), 8.868 more in 2012 and 4.714 in 2017 (see \cite{usreport}). It's estimated that more than 125.000 children have been adopted in the United States alone since 1986 (source can be found in \cite{caringfor}). Further data on annual U.S. international adoptions and their social and financial costs can be found at \cite{usreportsite}. More in depth medical issues, will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:roleofpediatrician}.

Although personal experiences obviously vary, most children placed for international adoption have some history of poverty and social hardship in their home countries, and approximately 65\% are adopted from orphanage or institutional settings (as stated in \cite{caringfor}). As explained in \cite{nelson}, the effects of institutionalization and other early life stresses impact all areas of early growth and development. As a result, many children require specialized support and understanding to overcome such impacts and to reach their full potential. 

Moreover, as in \cite{unreport}, internationally adopted children may withstand a number of juridical and social impairments even after adoption. No generalization can be made on this matter though, since laws and policies greatly differing among countries. They may be stripped of their name (a.e. in Cape Verde, Argentina and Turkey), have no right to inheritance (a.e. in Republic of Moldova and France), see the termination of the relationship with birth parents and relatives (a.e. in Japan, Albania and Togolese Republic), loose their citizenship and not acquire a new one (a.e. Hungary and New Zealand), or even bear limitations on marriage in their adult life (a.e. in Argentina and France). These boundaries are to be considered associated to the emotional and psychological stress of new surroundings, new affections, new habits, and even new climatic environments (which can be clinically relevant, as explained in \ref{sub:vitaminddeficiency}). \linebreak All these elements account for some of the factors that contribute to the hardships an adoptee must endure throughout his life and call for a strong action from pediatric physicians and social services employees, as possible support figures which may change these kids' lives forever.

\subsection{Levels and trends in intercountry adoption worldwide}\label{sub:levelsintercountry}
International adoption is increasingly considered a measure of last resort worldwide, if the child's birth family or community are unable or unwilling to care for him anymore (see \cite{nelson}), justifying the downward trend on international adoptions across the globe. 

The United Nations Population Division estimates that about 40.000 intercountry adoptions took place each year around 2005, accounting for 15\% of the total number of adoptions (see \cite{unreport}). As shown in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesdestination} and \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}, the involved countries, both for destination and origin, are relatively few.

Destination countries are led by the United States with over 127.000 total adoptions in 2001 Even though it accounts for nearly half of all adoptions, only 15\% of American families decide to take care of a child coming from outside the US. France and Spain (both with a significant annual adoptions, ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 adoptions per year), instead, embrace 80-90\% of all adoptions from foreign lands, although they have far less total adoptions per year. Almost all countries adopt primarily from China and Russia, confirming data shown in \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}. The median percentage of international adoptions in all examined countries is 64\, a remarkable value and effort in helping children from developing countries.

The Italian adoption status will be discussed in \ref{sub:intadoptioninitaly}.

Countries of origin are better balanced throughout the globe, with China leading the chart, followed by Russia, Guatemala and Ukraine. Guatemala and Ethiopia stand out for the exceptional percentage of international adoptions among all, with 97\% and 93\% respectively. As clearly shown in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}, the United States are the preferred destination country for most of the listed nations. 

All of the countries listed below struggle with some sort of social hardship: political instability, poverty, inequality, starvation, ethnic or civil wars, complex and violent pasts. Eyes can't closed and mouths shut, when it so obviously portrayed that children are the ones paying from these adulthood failures. They must run, be saved, separated, deported in order to be granted one single chance, one single hope.

As explained in \cite{adoptdropping_article} and \cite{adoptdropping_book}, in recent years, international adoption rates have been dropping. As shown in the Figure \ref{fig:usadoptionsdropping}, the United States' foreign adoptions have dramatically fallen from 18.856 children per year in 2000 to 2.681 in 2016: more than 75\% has been cut. This isn't a U.S. isolated problem, though; world-wide international adoption rates are on the fall in the past two decades, due to policy changes in the countries of origin. In recent decades South Korea, Romania, Guatemala, China, Kazakhistan and Russia, all former leaders in foreign adoption (see \cite{unreport} and Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}), have banned or cut back on international custody transfers. For example, the number of Guatemalan children adopted by foreign parents dropped from 4100 in 2008 to a stunning 58 in 2010 (\ref{figdata:guatemala} in Figure \ref{fig:usadoptionsdropping}), after the country drastically curtailed the practice and China decreased its foreign adoptions by 86\% in a decade (\ref{figdata:china} in Figure \ref{fig:usadoptionsdropping}).

As policies change, it's often stated that it's in ``the best interest of the child", a point usually supported by a strong media-driven high-profile infantile abuse or neglect case. These incidents are rare: only a 0.03\% rate. In Russia, on the other hand, the rate of child abuse is about 25 times higher. Such statistics call into question whether the child's best interest is really why countries have been canceling international adoption. Authors have found that political pressures and international embarrassment  can spur countries to halt adoptions. After the \textit{moratorium} on foreign adoptions in Guatemala, a former member of the country's National Adoption Council expressed pride. ``Our image as being the number one exporter of children has changed", he said. ``Guatemala has dignity", again, he added.

Moreover, poor countries often struggle to meet The Hague Convention policy's high standards, which include creating a central adoption authority, accrediting local agencies and tightening approval procedures, making such a rigorous international regulation more expensive. Fees have been applied on agencies, adoptive parents, orphanages and countries. This 1993 global agreement, signed by 103 countries in 2016, which meant to make adoption safer and more straightforward, has contributed to their decline.

Foreign adoptions can't solve global poverty. But ending them merely punishes thousands of vulnerable kids and their potential parents worldwide. And that's in nobody's best interest.

\subsection{International adoption in Italy}\label{sub:intadoptioninitaly}
According to \cite{notonlyinfectious}, \cite{nonsoloinfezioni} and \cite{cai2014}, in 2014 Italy was the European country with the highest rate of adoptions and the second one worldwide, following the United States. This major role was confirmed in the next two-year period: 2.716 children were adopted from foreign countries in 2016/17 (see \cite{cai2016}), keeping Italy second worldwide for international custody transfers (see \cite{adoptdropping_article} and \cite{adoptdropping_book}).
As of \cite{unreport}, in 1999 Italy was the forth country worldwide for international adoptions with 2.177 international adoptions, amounting to 68\% of national total. Most of the Italian adoptees are from the Russia Federation (as shown in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesdestination}) and Italy is Bulgaria's favorite country of destination (in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}).

Table \ref{tab:italianregions} shows that Lombardia, Veneto and Lazio were the leading Italian regions for international adoption in 2016-2017, followed by Toscana and Campania. \textit{De facto}, the northern and central portions of the country are the most active adoption-wise.  Overall and regional numbers are dropping, in the same manner as it is happening all over the globe, as explained in Section \ref{sub:levelsintercountry}, but a few exceptions stand out. Abruzzo and Basilicata increased their annual adoptions, from 20 to 28 (the first), and from 13 to 85 (the latter). Even more exceptional is Valle d'Aosta, that scored a flat \textit{zero} in both years. It must be said, though, that it's the least populated region, with only 125.000 people living in the whole region.

Most of these children, between 40 and 50\%, span between 5 and 9 years of age at their arrival in Italy, and less than 15\% are really young (younger than one year-olds) or the older ones (older than 10). 

In 2016 and 2017, the most fertile countries of origin are the same in both years, even though they swap internal ratings: Russian Federation, Colombia, India, Hungary, Poland, Vietnam, Brazil and China (as stated in \cite{cai2016}). The children from these country amount for ~73\% of the total international adoptions.

\section{Role of the pediatrician}\label{sec:roleofpediatrician}
%SEE NELSON, ROLE OF PEDIATRICIAN P. 223
%QUALI PROBLEMATICHE HANNO DALLA LETTERATURA? VEDI ARTICOLI NON SOLO INFEZIONI! e 7.3 e 1.2
Internationally adopted children come from countries with many endemic diseases, including hepatitis B, tuberculosis and many different intestinal parasites (as explained in \cite{caringfor}). These children have lived in crowded conditions, sometimes with poor standards of hygiene and inadequate nutrition. These children are malnourished, often suffer from emotional and physical neglect, and are therefore vulnerable to infectious diseases. And although children must obtain medical clearance as part of the process of applying for a visa to travel around the globe, the evaluation is usually cursory, therefore unreliable. The physician appointed to establish this sketchy health status certificate, is directed to evaluate the child for ``serious contagious diseases or disabilities". However, no blood testing is required or other screening is mandated unless risk factors are identified.

According to \cite{medicalscreening}, more than 50\% of internationally adopted children, regardless of sex, age, and country of origin, will have a previously undiagnosed medical condition, which is identified on initial evalutian. Therefore, adoption-medicine specializied pediatricians should advise prospective parents on appropriate testing of the child after arrival in the country of destination. Early screening is crucial in order to identify eventual pathological conditions and to prevent what could be irreversible damage. As can be found in \cite{initialeval} and \cite{redbook}, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends careful health screening of all newly arrived international adoptees.

\textit{What screening tests should be ordered by physicians caring for newly arrived international adoptees?} In addition to hepatitis A, B and C, HIV, congenital syphilis, other STIs, intestinal parasites, and tuberculosis by Mantoux testing, experts also reccomend testing for anemia, thyroid and renal disease, vision and hearing defects, and newborn metabolic disorders when appropriate, along with careful monitoring of growth and development (according to \cite{caringfor}, and \cite{medicalscreening}). Moreover, \cite{caringfor}, \cite{medicalscreening}, \cite{initialeval}, \cite{immunizationstatus}, \cite{comphealtheval}, and \cite{immunizationstillinsufficient} are only some of the examples of a medical literature full to the brim, which compels physician to test for adequate immunization status. Pre-adoptive immunization records may not be assumed as truthful or correct, according to \cite{immunizationstatus}. As discussed in TODO, this may happens because the cold chain gets interrupted, or because of too big intervals between somministrations. %TODO

Although concern about HIV infection causes considerable anxiety, very few internationally adopted children have arrived with this infection (see \cite{caringfor}). Either HIV-infected children do not survive long enough to complete an international adoption procedure or local screening identifies infected children and removes them from consideration for adoption. 

Several systematic reviews and eminent periodicals focused on infectious disease risk among internationally adopted children, while data regarding prevalence and spectrum of non-infectious conditions, including special needs, are poor (see \cite{notonlyinfectious} and \cite{nonsoloinfezioni}).
