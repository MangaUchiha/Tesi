\chap{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
Children's health has historically always been a sensitive and concerning matter for human kind. We can find reason for this in our universal instinctive draw towards the protection and care for our offspring, and in how children can be struck by some of the most devastating and life-wrecking diseases. Sometimes, these are the phenotypical expression of genetical marks, scarred onto and into these kids. Despite the origin, the color of the skin or the culture the child bears in his lineage, human beings feel the need to raise and safeguard them from all harms, on a physical, emotional and spiritual level. This is one of the strongest biological calls to action.

Thus, pediatrics must care and remember that children's health and well-being must be guarded across political borders, across poverty, across starvation. This thesis, and the paper it's so deeply bound to, set themselves to renew this vow.

\section{Intercountry and international adoptees}\label{sec:internationaladoptees}
International adoptees are children with special needs: a vulnerable paediatric population with a chronic condition that requires access to a wide variety of health care services (as defined by \cite{notonlyinfectious} and \cite{nonsoloinfezioni}). Compared to 19\% of the general population, approximately 39\% of adopted children require special healthcare attention (as extensively explained in \cite{nelson}). They are of school age, part of a sibling group, members of historically oppressed racial or ethnic groups, or they have considerable physical, emotional, or developmental need: all potential elements of vulnerability endangering the child's healthy upbringing. This is not a limited problem: annually more than 30.000 kids are adopted across countries, and, in the United States, of all 136.000 national adoptees in 2008, almost 25\% come from foreign countries; U.S. families adopted 22.884 children in 2004, mostly from China (which accounts for 33\% alone), Ehtiopia, Russia and South Korea (see \cite{nelson}), 8.868 more in 2012 and 4.714 in 2017 (see \cite{usreport}). Further data on annual U.S. international adoptions and their social and financial costs can be found at \cite{usreportsite}.

Although personal experiences obviously vary, most children placed for international adoption have some history of poverty and social hardship in their home countries, and approximately 65\% are adopted from orphanage or institutional settings. As explained in \cite{nelson}, the effects of institutionalization and other early life stresses impact all areas of early growth and development. As a result, many children require specialized support and understanding to overcome such impacts and to reach their full potential. 

Moreover, as in \cite{unreport}, internationally adopted children may withstand a number of juridical and social impairments even after adoption. No generalization can be made on this matter though, since laws and policies greatly differing among countries. They may be stripped of their name (a.e. in Cape Verde, Argentina and Turkey), have no right to inheritance (a.e. in Republic of Moldova and France), see the termination of the relationship with birth parents and relatives (a.e. in Japan, Albania and Togolese Republic), loose their citizenship and not acquire a new one (a.e. Hungary and New Zealand), or even bear limitations on marriage in their adult life (a.e. in Argentina and France). These boundaries are to be considered associated to the emotional and psychological stress of new surroundings, new affections, new habits, and even new climatic environments (which can be clinically relevant, as explained in \ref{sub:vitaminddeficiency}). \linebreak All these elements account for some of the factors that contribute to the hardships an adoptee must endure throughout his life and call for a strong action from pediatric physicians and social services employees, as possible support figures which may change these kids' lives forever.

\subsection{Levels and trends in intercountry adoption worldwide}\label{sub:levelsintercountry}
International adoption is increasingly considered a measure of last resort worldwide, if the child's birth family or community are unable or unwilling to care for him anymore (see \cite{nelson}), justifying the downward trend on international adoptions across the globe. 
%INSERISCI ARTICOLO

The United Nations Population Division estimates that about 40.000 intercountry adoptions took place each year around 2005, accounting for 15\% of the total number of adoptions (see \cite{unreport}). As shown in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesdestination} and \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}, the involved countries, both for destination and origin, are relatively few.

Destination countries are led by the United States with over 127.000 total adoptions in 2001 Even though it accounts for nearly half of all adoptions, only 15\% of American families decide to take care of a child coming from outside the US. France and Spain (both with a significant annual adoptions, ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 adoptions per year), instead, embrace 80-90\% of all adoptions from foreign lands, although they have far less total adoptions per year. Almost all countries adopt primarily from China and Russia, confirming data shown in \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}. The median percentage of international adoptions in all examined countries is 64\, a remarkable value and effort in helping children from developing countries.

The Italian adoption status will be discussed in \ref{sub:intadoptionsinitaly}.

Countries of origin are better balanced throughout the globe, with China leading the chart, followed by Russia, Guatemala and Ukraine. Guatemala and Ethiopia stand out for the exceptional percentage of international adoptions among all, with 97\% and 93\% respectively. As clearly shown in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}, the United States are the preferred destination country for most of the listed nations. 

All of the countries listed below struggle with some sort of social hardship: political instability, poverty, inequality, starvation, ethnic or civil wars, complex and violent pasts. Eyes can't closed and mouths shut, when it so obviously portrayed that children are the ones paying from these adulthood failures. They must run, be saved, separated, deported in order to be granted one single chance, one single hope.

\subsection{International adoptions in Italy}\label{sub:intadoptionsinitaly}
According to \cite{notonlyinfectious}, \cite{nonsoloinfezioni} and \cite{cai2014}, Italy is the European country with the highest rate of adoptions and the second one worldwide, following the United States. This major role was kept in the next two-year period: 2.716 children were internationally adopted in Italy in 2016-17 (see \cite{cai2016}).
As of \cite{unreport}, Italy is the forth country worldwide for international adoptions with 2.177 international adoptions in 1999, amounting to 68\% of national total. Most of the Italian adoptees are from the Russia Federation (as shown in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesdestination}) and Italy is Bulgaria's favorite country of destination (in Table \ref{tab:intadoptcountriesorigin}).


\section{Health status and screening protocols}\label{sec:screeningprotocols}
%SEE NELSON, ROLE OF PEDIATRICIAN P. 223
Screening at arrival is important in order to identify eventual pathological conditions. Several reports focused on infectious disease risk among internationally adopted children (IAC), while data regarding prevalence and spectrum of non-infectious conditions, including special needs, are poor (see \cite{notonlyinfectious} and \cite{nonsoloinfezioni}).
